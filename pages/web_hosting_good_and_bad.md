### Hosting Companies I've had poor experiences with, why and when

* Allstream (poor customer service, long downtime) 2011
* Bluehost (oversold boxes, limited mysql resources resulting in downed sites) 2012-2013

### Hosting Companies I Like

* RamNode (good service, strong tech support, fast kvm boxes) 2013
* Linode (dependable) 2009-2013
* SSDVirt (same as ramnode, tech support doesn't sleep) 2013
